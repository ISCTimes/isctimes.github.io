Website for newspaper club for International School of Como.

Developed by a non-front-end web developer with some experience with back-end development.

This is draft 1, with basic layout. Purpose of the draft 1 is to test the functionality of the static website.

#Things I am keeping in mind
How much storage I am taking. 

Making it so that the website actually fetches article data, although at the moment I am not totally sure how it would work. I may be making a mistake in assuming that the client side can make a get request. 

Since the website is static, I will be using 404.html to redirect to the articles, and simulate a "article.php?id=some_id" using substrings.
